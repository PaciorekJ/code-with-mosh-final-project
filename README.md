# Motivation for this project
This was the final project for Mosh Hamedani's "The Ultimate HTML/CSS Mastery Series." This project served as an opportunity to combine all the knowledge obtained through parts one and two of this course.
# What is the project
A website for a fictitious company that specializes in cloud hosting.
# How was the website developed
The website was developed incrementally by creating each component of the mock design independently. This allowed me to ensure that each component was functional before including it in a large piece or the end product.
After all the components were developed, the components were used to build the website. Each component can be viewed [here](./components)
# How was the website deployed
The project was built and packaged for deployment using a parcel. The project was deployed using Netlify and can be viewed [here](https://moshify-jason-paciorek.netlify.app/)
