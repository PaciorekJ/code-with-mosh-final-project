# Motivation for this project
This was the final project for Mosh Hamedani's "The Ultimate HTML/CSS Mastery Series". This final project served as an oppounitity to combine all the knowledge obtained through part one and two of this course.
# What is the project
A website for a ficticious company that specializes in cloud hosting.
# How was the website developed
The website was developed incrementally by creating each component of the mock design independly. This allowed me to ensure that each component was functional before including it in a large component or the end product.
After all components were developed, the components used build the website. Each component can be view [here](./components)
